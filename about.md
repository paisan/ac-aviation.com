AC Aviation Company Limited or commercially known as Bangkok Jets was
founded on the belief that charter flight service could be done
better. Not by buying bigger planes, or building larger facilities,
but by thinking small down to the last detail. By looking at the
charter flight business from the customer’s point of view, we realized
that the best possible flight experience came from superior service.



 In building Bangkok Jets around this passenger-centric view, we
 created a business philosophy of anticipating problems before they
 happen, and making sure that connections are always made and
 communication is never lost. Our mission is to provide the best
 charter flight journeys for our passenger, from endpoint to endpoint,
 by designing and maintaining the experience from the passenger point
 of view. You’ll see it in everything we do.
