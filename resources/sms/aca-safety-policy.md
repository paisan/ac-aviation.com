# AC Aviation Safety Policy

_Safety is important to us as and is one of our core business functions._

Our safety objective is simply for no aircraft accidents to occur as a
result of our operations.  Therefore it is important that we meet all
applicable regulations and where appropriate exceed them when a safety
risk is identified.

We believe in a reporting system that allows people to report safety
issues without fear of unfair reprisals. Everybody makes mistakes, and
honest mistakes will be treated fairly. A healthy reporting system
gives us the information to address safety issues as they arise, not
when it is too late. We expect everyone who works or is connected to
our operations to report any safety related events or issues they
identify to me or one of our staff. In this respect we will apply just
culture principles to any event that is reported to us directly in a
timely manner.

This will help our organization to continuously improve our safety
performance which is a shared responsibility.
